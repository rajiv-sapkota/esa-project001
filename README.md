# Retro Terminal on Aliyun ESA 🚀

_ESA Competition Entry | Retro Cyberpunk Portfolio_

## Project Overview

This project is a creative submission for the **Aliyun ESA (Edge Security Acceleration) Competition**. It reimagines the personal portfolio as an interactive, CLI-based experience, paying homage to the "hacker" aesthetics of the 90s and early 2000s cyberculture.

Deployed on **Aliyun ESA**, this static site leverages edge computing capabilities to deliver a lightning-fast, globally accessible "terminal" to users anywhere in the world.

## Design Philosophy: "Digital Nostalgia"

In an era of clean, minimalist, and often sterile UI design, the **Retro Terminal** aims to bring back the feeling of *exploration* and *mystery* that characterized the early internet.

*   **The "Living" Machine**: The site isn't just a document; it's a simulation. The scanlines, screen curvature, and phosphor glow mimic the physical imperfections of old CRT monitors, making the digital experience feel tangible and "warm."
*   **Interaction is Key**: Instead of passively scrolling, users must actively "talk" to the system via commands. This gamifies the experience and creates a deeper engagement loop.
*   **Performance + Aesthetics**: By building with **Vite + React** and deploying to **Aliyun ESA**, we prove that heavy visual stylization (animations, canvas effects) can coexist with modern high-performance infrastructure.

## Key Features

*   📺 **CRT Simulation**: Realistic scanlines, vignette, and screen flicker effects.
*   ⌨️ **Interactive Terminal**: Fully functional command parser with history navigation.
*   🌧️ **Matrix Mode**: High-performance Canvas 2D digital rain effect (Type `matrix` or `矩阵Matrix`).
*   ⚡ **Aliyun ESA Deployed**: Optimized for edge delivery with single-page app routing validation.
